# Password-generator
## I will create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they've selected. The app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that i will write. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
- no user instrution
